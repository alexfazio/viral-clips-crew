Now, you've seen for years now one of my favorite party tricks has been this sheet of magnet paper. You just lay it down on any device to see where a few of the internals are like the mag safe magnet array or the speaker. D Brand's x-ray line takes that magnet paper experience to a whole another level letting you see basically every single component inside your device and yes this is an actual legit x-ray of that device yes dbrand took hundreds of devices to a Metrology lab and literally shot each one of them with a special x-ray machine for maximum accuracy."
