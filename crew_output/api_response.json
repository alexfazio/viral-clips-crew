So there's this poor Italian female boxer named Angela Carini. She's been training for years for this. Her Algerian opponent was called Amini Kelif, who was basically a bloke, walked into the ring and basically knocked this poor Italian woman senseless for 46 seconds, at which point, with sobbing her eyes out, the Italian lady said, I can't go on. This is a bloke beating up a woman. I mean, what the hell is going on, Renee? This is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen."

            "text": "So this is actually a man, but it's a man who has had his chromosomes tested and he is XY. What does that mean exactly? Right, so only a man can have chromosomes that are XY. Women are XX, men are XY. So is this not a trans woman? No. Okay, explain. This is a man who likely has what's called DSD. So when he was born, he didn't have normal male genitalia and it looked like a woman and he's probably been raised as a woman. It's sad, actually, in that respect. However, he will have internal testes, so he will go through normal male puberty, he will gain all of those advantages and he will be as strong as a man boxing. A man in a boxing ring has 2.6 times the power of a woman when they throw a punch."

            "text": "This man has history. He was banned from the World Championships last night because he tested positive for being a man. This is last year's World Championship. He failed the test. You never pass it once you've failed it. Why was he allowed into the Olympics? Because the Olympics have got different rules. Boxing is one of the, many of the competitions, to be fair, have now banned trans women or people who could be classified as male from competing against women. He looks a lot like a man there. Why you need to even consider this is madness. Just to bring you back to the horror that happened in this ring, this guy came into the ring, punched this poor lady, Angela Carini, twice in the face. She fell to the floor, sobbing, screaming, this is unjust. And afterwards she refused to shake his hand."
