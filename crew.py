            You will be provided with a list of transcription extracts from a video clip, and the full content of an .srt subtitle file corresponding to that clip. Your task is to match each transcription extract to the subtitle segment it best aligns with, and return the results in a specific format.

            - No notes about which extracts matched which segments
            - No additional text that isn't part of the subtitle segments
